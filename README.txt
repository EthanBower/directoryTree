This script will scan through a user-defined directory and create a directory tree. In addition, it can search for files.

This script is just a fun project, and shouldn't be used seriously unless you are me... Since I search for files constantly on my Raspberry Pi, this will 
come in handy (despite there being something like this on the terminal).
